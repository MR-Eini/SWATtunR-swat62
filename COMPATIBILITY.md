# SWAT+ 62 compatibility development fork

This repository preserves the upstream history and license of SWATtunR. Package names remain unchanged so existing R scripts can continue using `library(SWATtunR)`. This is a tested development update, not an upstream release.

Upstream starting commit: `a5542265eba539fdc4177466f582dd00091d6018`. SWATrunR uses upstream `remove_legacy` (1.1.0.9017), matching the bundled workflow; its one local difference was portable library propagation to workers, which is retained in this update.

## Verified scope

Windows, R 4.5.2; supplied Mini_setup_CREATE model at commit `f3c8035a697567f41973445754d45c650c170db5`; four-year runs (2004–2007) with 2007 daily output. The official Intel revision 62 executable completed the runs. The official GNU 62.0.0 executable raised a floating-point exception during weather initialization on this model.

- Two parameter sets execute in parallel and a curve-number change alters basin runoff.
- Verification reads 314 HRUs, 114,610 daily plant/weather records and 4,212 management records without truncating files.
- The legacy 61.0_M executable still completes through the updated runner.
- Calibration export includes ordinary and plant-only parameter sets. Maturity fields require whole numbers.
- Focused tests cover changed control layouts, adjacent fixed-width output labels, date alignment, calibration precision and invalid run indices.

The updated runner and verifier require `SWATreadR >= 0.1.0.9012` from [MR-Eini/SWATreadR-swat62](https://github.com/MR-Eini/SWATreadR-swat62). Install that source package first, then the other packages, into the same R library. These repositories are private development copies; GitHub installation requires access to them. Git clone followed by local R package installation also works.

## Model conversion is a separate step

Replacing the executable alone is insufficient. For this non-carbon reference model, migration adds the optional carbon-file slot to the basin row of `file.cio`, writes integer `days_mat`/`yrs_mat` values in `plants.plt`, and converts `print.prt` to named-object mode. The obsolete `region_cha` output row is removed; `region_sd_cha` remains available. Existing hydrologic parameter values are retained.

The package helpers preserve extra control fields and use output headers. They do not invent values for new physical processes or promise compatibility with every future schema. Carbon, GWFlow, time-series recall, other catchments, non-Windows executables, and a full scientific recalibration/validation remain outside the completed test coverage. The existing workflow's Editor 2.1.0 setup database and SWATprepR/SWATfarmR generation routines require a separate migration before regenerating arbitrary revision 62 projects.

The legacy and new executables produce different unperturbed mean daily basin runoff in this test (0.338866 vs 0.359504 mm/day). This is an observed model-version difference, not a validation against measurements.

## Full supplied-workflow tests (3 September 2026)

The supplied SWATdoctR verification, SWATrunR execution/storage, and SWATtunR discharge calibration/validation, sensitivity, crop and water-yield workflows were executed on model copies. Three stress-mode runs cover 2004–2023 and read 1,949,626 daily HRU records per mode. Eight discharge samples cover 2007–2015 outputs (3,287 days); two selected validation runs cover 2016–2023 (2,922 days). Eight variables save to SQLite and reload; discharge observations match all evaluation dates. Crop tests use three maturity adjustments, four crop-yield samples and four esco/epco combinations plus check runs. CSV exports, PDF plots and interactive hydrographs were produced locally.

The annual basin output includes unlabelled `cal_sim` (29 characters) and `cal_adj` (17 characters), after its water-balance fields. SWATreadR 0.1.0.9012 reads these without assigning them to crop labels; SWATdoctR uses that reader. SWATtunR warns about observation-only crops and prevents misaligned PHU/yield/biomass panels. Sixteen regression cases / 64 expectations pass, including native annual output and cropped-panel coverage.

These are compatibility tests with small parameter samples. No discharge sample meets the supplied fit thresholds, and channel 6 in the script differs from the observation filename `q_cha5_cms.csv`; gauge mapping needs confirmation. The water-yield check is about 0.334 against target 0.133. `lupn` and `oats` observations have no matching simulated harvests. The selected validation runs are test cases, not accepted calibrated sets. The complete numerical summary is in `compatibility/workflow-summary.json`; full model and observation data stay in the local workspace.
